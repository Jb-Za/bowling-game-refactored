# GG-Bowling-Assignment

A simple React app that keeps track of scores for a bowling game. Users can roll the ball by clicking on the "Roll" button, and the app will generate a random score for the player. Users can also reset the scoreboard by clicking on the "Reset" button.

# Setup
To run the project locally, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in the terminal. Then, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

# Usage
To start the app, run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the app on your local server, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Once the app is running, you can click on the "Roll" button to generate a random score for the player. The app will automatically update the scoreboard with the new score. To reset the scoreboard, click on the "Reset" button.

# Testing 
To run the unit test scripts use the following command: 

```
npm run test
```
